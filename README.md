# Stack Size Increase Mod

This mod increases the stack size for all Total Miner items that normally stack to 100. The stack size is configurable with an XML Config file. It can also be set to increase the stack size of all items without durability instead.

This mod works with all modded items.

### Mod disabled or stack size changed.

Item stacks will not break. If they are in your inventory, they will remain stacked but additional items cannot be added to the stack. If the stack is split, the stacks cannot be recombined. If they are in a chest, they will be split when removed from the chest.
